## Features

This extension allows a user to extend their vocabulary with the use of the Thesauraptor! Features include getting a list synonyms and definitions for a word.

TODO: Add animation to show this.

## Known Issues

Getting the list of antonyms is a bit more difficult as the Wordpos library does not give this functionality. Later release might include the use of https://dictionaryapi.com/ where the user must provide their own API key. This is a free API for up to 1000 requests a day.
